# RedistributionCOVID19
Data collected for the project "Reallocating and Sharing Health Equipments in Sanitary Emergency Situations: The COVID-19 Case in Spain"

We show two different folders as results of our project. 
* **01_ModelsResults** contains the different results of our models described in the project.
* **02_Graphs contains** the graphs shown in the project for all objectives, regions, and graphs. It also contains other graphs that compare the different models and that were not published in the project.

We have tried to put a common sintax in the names of the different files:
* *Regions:* Mad = Madrid, And = Andaluc√≠a.
* *Graph structures:* CL = Logistic Center graph, Comp = Complete graph.
* *Scenarios:* Sce0 = Real Scenario, Sce1 = Pessimistic Scenario, Sce2 = Optimistic Scenario.
* *Objectives:* Obj1-4 = Objectives from 1 to 4. Obj5-8 = Objectives for regret from 1 to 4.
