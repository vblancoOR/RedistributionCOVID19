# Graphs

<h3>Redistribution vs. No Redistribution</h3>
We have the graphs by means of regions, graph structures and objectives, which compare  the non-covered demand, that is, the number of patients needing a ventilator that were not attended due to the lack of this resource, if the proposed redistribution is carried out, or not, in the differen scenarios. Thus, here we have two section which are described in the project: *Redistribution vs. No Redistribution* section, and *Comparison of Non-covered Demand by Scenarios* section.

<h3>Comparison of Redistribution and Sharing Policies</h3>
We compare in this section the behavior of the redistribution through the time horizon and regions. We have the amount of redistributed stock and the curves of scenario demands. In this folder, we have two different types of graphs:
* *BarGraphs:* BarGraphs are the amount of redistributed stock and scenario demand curves.
* *PieCharts:* PieCharts are how the ExtraStock has been redistributed in Andaluc√≠a region.

<h3>Complete Graph vs. Logistic Center Graph</h3>


<h3>Different Criteria</h3>
We compare in this last section the regret version (dashed line) versus the not regret version (continuous line) of different objective functions.
